/**
 * Guards the rule sets against the failure that made the Problems panel useless:
 * a pattern that backtracks exponentially.
 *
 * <p>{@code P_METHOD_DECL} used to be
 * {@code ...[\w<>,\s?]+\s+(\w+)\s*\(} — a character class containing {@code \s}
 * immediately before {@code \s+}. Both can claim the same spaces, so a line that
 * does not ultimately match costs the engine every way of splitting them.</p>
 *
 * <p>The cost is spread, not concentrated: no single line took even forty
 * milliseconds, but the ordinary failing line cost two to twelve, and there are
 * seventy-seven thousand of them in this project. Scanning it once did not finish
 * in ten minutes. On a two-thousand-file project the sweep never reached the end,
 * so the Problems panel stayed empty while a thread burned a core.</p>

 * <p>That is why these are volume tests rather than single-line ones, and why the
 * budgets are set from measurement: with the pattern fixed the two timed tests
 * take 0.20s and 0.01s; with the old one they took 1.62s and 0.70s. The budgets
 * sit between, with several times' headroom over the fixed figures.</p>

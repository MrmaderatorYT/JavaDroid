/**
 * The editors on screen and what each of them is showing.
 *
 * <p>This is the state {@code MainActivity} grew around. Measured before it was
 * pulled out: {@code activeEditor} was named 154 times in that one file,
 * {@code tabsAdapter} 121, and the twenty fields here 584 times between them.
 * That is why extracting <em>methods</em> from that class never worked — the
 * least-coupled forty of them still needed fourteen collaborators, because
 * anything that touches a file needs half of this.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a plain holder, not a manager. The fields are package-visible
 * and the behaviour stays where it already is, so pulling them together changes
 * nothing at runtime and cannot change behaviour. What it buys is a name: the
 * controllers that currently take a whole {@code MainActivity} can be handed
 * this instead, and each field can then be closed off one at a time behind an
 * accessor without another five-hundred-site edit.</p>
 *
 * <p>One instance per activity, created with it and living as long as it does.
 * Nothing here is touched off the main thread.</p>

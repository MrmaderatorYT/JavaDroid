/**
 * The one place that knows whether the user has asked the current run to stop.
 *
 * <p>Stopping a program on Android cannot be a single kill: the work is spread
 * across a build phase (ECJ, D8, dependency resolution), a test phase (JUnit
 * invoked reflectively) and an execution phase (ART or the {@code :javase}
 * process). Only the last of those can be terminated outright. The other two
 * have to notice and unwind, which is what {@link #isStopRequested()} is for —
 * every long phase checks it at its own boundaries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The generation counter covers what interrupting cannot. A thread stuck in
 * a loop that ignores interrupts keeps running after Stop, and its output would
 * otherwise land in the console of whatever the user does next. Every callback
 * captures the generation it was created in and drops anything posted after
 * that generation has passed, so a run the user walked away from stays silent.</p>

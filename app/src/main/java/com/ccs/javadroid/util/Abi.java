/**
 * Which word size this process is running at.
 *
 * <p>Screens that are expensive to build have two paths: the original one, which
 * builds everything before the first frame, and a staged one, which puts the
 * visible part up first and fills in the rest over the following frames. This
 * decides which path is taken.</p>
 *
 * <p>The staged path is limited to 32-bit because that is where the cost was
 * measured — {@code SettingsActivity} took 2099 ms to appear on a 32-bit debug
 * build and 288 ms once staged. No equivalent measurement exists for a 64-bit
 * process, so those keep the behaviour they always had.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note this is the <em>process</em> word size, not the device's: a 64-bit
 * phone still reports {@code true} here if the app happens to be running in a
 * 32-bit process.</p>

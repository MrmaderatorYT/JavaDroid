 * What to do with a file that is too big to treat like source.

 * <p>Highlighting costs time proportional to the text, and so does every pass
 * that runs after it — the outline, the live problems, the minimap. On a
 * generated file, a bundled dataset or a log, all of that is spent producing
 * colour nobody asked for, and the editor stops responding while it happens.</p>
 *
 * <p>So size decides how much the editor does. The thresholds are deliberately
 * generous: a real source file almost never crosses them, and the point is to
 * stay out of the way until something is clearly not source.</p>

 * Finds the blocks a long file can be collapsed into.
 *
 * <p>A 2000-line class is mostly scrolling. Folding the bodies away leaves the
 * signatures, which is the view you want when looking for a method rather than
 * reading one.</p>
 *
 * <p>Braces, not a parser. A real AST would know a lambda from a class body, but
 * it would also need the file to compile — and a file being edited usually does
 * not. Brace matching survives half-typed code, which is when folding is most
 * useful. Comments, strings and character literals are skipped so a {@code "}"}
 * inside a string does not close anything.</p>
 *
 * <p>Kept free of editor types so the rules can be tested against plain
 * strings.</p>

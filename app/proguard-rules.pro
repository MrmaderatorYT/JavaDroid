# ── Obfuscation only, deliberately ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# R8 does three separate jobs: shrinking, optimization and obfuscation. Google
# Play's metric is about the third. The first two were measured on this app at
# close to an hour of build time, because R8 has to analyse the whole bundled
# toolchain — ECJ, the Kotlin compiler, R8 itself — and they buy little here:
# nearly all of that code is kept anyway, so there is nothing to remove.
#
# They also carry the risk that matters in an app that runs compilers: code
# reached only by reflection or ServiceLoader looks unused, and an optimizer
# that inlines or merges classes breaks the assumptions such code makes.
# Neither shrinking nor optimization, only obfuscation — which is the one of
# R8's three jobs the Play metric is about. Shrinking is under suspicion for
# breaking the bundled Kotlin compiler: its IntelliJ core registers extension
# points by reflection and reads listeners from resources R8 cannot see, so a
# class that looks unused is not.

# ── What R8 must not rename ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# minifyEnabled is on for release, so everything below is load-bearing rather
# than precautionary. Google Play measures how much of the app's own code is
# obfuscated; the bundled third-party toolchain is kept wholesale because it is
# what would break, and it is not what the measurement is about.

# Stack traces stay readable: line numbers are kept and the source file name is
# replaced by a placeholder rather than removed, so a crash report still maps
# back through the mapping file.
# Attributes, not just classes and members. R8 strips every attribute that is
# not listed here, and the bundled Kotlin compiler carries IntelliJ's component
# machinery, which registers extension points by reading annotations at run
# time. With the annotations gone, registration ran against a null component
# manager and the compiler environment failed to initialise at all:
#
#   AssertionError: Attempt to invoke ComponentManager.getService on a null
#   object reference — at ExtensionPointImpl.registerExtension
#
# Signature and InnerClasses matter for the same reason: reflection over
# generic types and nested classes is how these libraries find things.
